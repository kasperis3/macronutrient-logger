# macronutrient-logger

The Macronutrient Logger is a convenient way to track and calculate your daily or regular (macro) nutrient break downs.

Enter in a list of foods you ate on any given day. 
The app will query the USDA Food Data Central API (with subsequent calls stored in a local reservoir).

The food item will be added to your user profile along with a timestamp and all the nutrients of the food item as a row record. 

You can see these macro nutrients summed by day with the click of a button!

Updates to come:
- sort lists by most X, least Y, etc
- convert to React app where user can select foods and portion size from one page (currently redirects to multiple pages)
