# macronutrient-logger

The Macronutrient Logger is a convenient way to track and calculate your daily or regular (macro) nutrient break downs.

Enter in a list of foods you ate on any given day. 
The app will query the USDA Food Data Central API (with subsequent calls stored in a local reservoir).
The food item will be added to your user profile along with a timestamp as a row record.
